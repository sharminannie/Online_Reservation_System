## 
Create an Online Reservation System to help the customer and owner of the item to streamline the 
booking process and enhance customer experience. The system should allow customers to easily 
make reservations for a hotel, restaurant, vehicle through an intuitive and user-friendly interface. 
There will be 2 types of customers to this system; admin and customer who wants to reserve the item. 
Admin has full control over the system. Customer has to create account if he/she wants to reserve an 
item.
